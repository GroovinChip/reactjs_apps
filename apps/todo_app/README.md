# todo_app

This application is a basic todo app where the user can enter an item into a list. Items can be marked as complete; when items are marked as complete, they are removed from the list. 

This application was created with `npx nano-react-app`.

## Things I learned:
- I decided to approach this project by creating a `/components` directory and creating really basic boilerplate components (literally just an empty component definition and an export) to start myself off. This proved to be a good approach because it allowed me to quickly architect the app.
